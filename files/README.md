## Notes
I want this to be a reusable template (static html site) that I can deploy to other platforms besides Netlify. Here are several that I have in mind;
Github Pages,
Cloudflare Pages,
Firebase,
Amazon S3,
Zeit,
Forge,
Platform.sh,
Vercel,
Surge.sh,
Azure Static Web Apps,
Gatsby Cloud,
Static.app,
Render,
Gitlab

Let me know if this deployment will not work for any on the list above.

## Questions
I have roughly (700) documents in markdown format that I want to upload to this project. If you have any ideas on how to do that efficiently, please advise.
